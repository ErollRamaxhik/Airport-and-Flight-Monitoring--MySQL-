With the Database Management Project (for Airports and Flights), attributes the entities that hold all flight info are created. 
These tables of info are interconnected with the appropriate ForeignKeys and PrimaryKeys, 
thus creating a large diagram. SQL queries are then used to make queries, and edits for the info, entities, and attributes.
